# Structure UI - License Agreement

## Summary
So you wanna use our Structure UI library, eh? Well, we're just as thrilled as a beaver in a log pond. Use it, tweak it, share it like you would a two-four with your buds. But listen if you're a big, publicly-traded bigwig looking to roll our stuff into your empire, eh, we're gonna need you to toss a couple of loonies and toonies our way, got it?

## Definitions
- "**Software**": That's the Structure UI. It's the whole shebang—code, files, and the docs to.
- "**You**": Yep, you, whether you're down the road or halfway 'round the globe.
- "**Us**", "**We**", "**Our**": That’s Neural Systems Inc, your friendly neighbourhood coders.

## Permissions
1.	**Personal Use**: Fire it up on your laptop or whatever floats your boat. Free as a Canadian goose.
2.	**SME Use**: Small and medium enterprises? Go ahead, it’s all yours.
3.	**Distribution**: Feel free to share this Software like it's a secret fishing spot, but ya gotta keep this license in, alright?
4.	**Modification**: Add your own maple syrup to the mix, just remember to include your changes in the source code and keep this license.

## Conditions
1.	**Attribution**: Like any polite Canadian, give credit where it's due. Keep our names and copyright notices in there, eh?
2.	**Share and Share Alike**: Modify and redistribute all you like, but it's gotta be under the same license, bud. No locking it up like a prized hockey stick.

## Limitations
1.	**Big Leagues Clause**: Now listen, if you're a publicly-traded company and you're looking to cash in on our hard work, give us a shout for a commercial license. We'll negotiate faster than you can say "double-double.".
2.	**Worldwide Use**: We're based in the True North strong and free, but this license is good worldwide-like a Celine Dion hit.
3.	**Sold As-Is**: Look, bud, this is like buying a used Zamboni-you get what you get, and don't get upset. No warranties from us, eh.
4.	**Don't Sue Us, Buddy**: If something gets goofed up, we're not paying for the damages. You're on your own, like a Leafs fan in the playoffs.

## Governing Law
Put away your Nanaimo bars and listen up: this license is governed by the laws of the Great White North, Canada, eh.
